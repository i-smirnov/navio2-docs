It is possible to connect to Navio's onboard u-blox GPS module from u-center software. To do that ublox-spi-to-tcp application has to be run on Raspberry:

The utility is available from our GitHub Navio repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emlid/Navio2
cd Navio2/Utilities/ublox-spi-to-tcp
make
./ublox-spi-to-tcp 5000
```

It will open port 5000 and will wait for a connection.

Open u-center, navigate to Receiver - Port - Network connection - New. Enter the IP address of your Raspberry:

You should see messages coming from the receiver in the Packet console as well as other visual data.
